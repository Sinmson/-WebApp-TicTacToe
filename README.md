##How to use:
1. Clone the repository
2. Run "npm install" ( to get all modules)

##How to develop:
1. Open 2 consoles
  - Run "webpack --watch" ( to automaticly build the build.js after safes)
  - Run "node server" ( runs on port 3000)
2. If compass installed ( needed to compile scss files)
  - Run "compass watch"

Do not edit css files, they get overwriten when compass compiles.
